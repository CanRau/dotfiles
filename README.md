Thinking about using [SuperCuber/dotter](https://github.com/SuperCuber/dotter) or [twpayne/chezmoi](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi) once I get to overhaul my dotfiles ðŸ¤“

Benefits over other tools: 
- single binary, which can be part of the dotfiles repo (no other dependencies needed)
- templating
- hooks / scripts
