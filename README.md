Thinking about using [twpayne/chezmoi](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi) (or alternatively [SuperCuber/dotter](https://github.com/SuperCuber/dotter))  once I get to overhaul my dotfiles ðŸ¤“

Benefits over other tools: 
- single binary, which can be part of the dotfiles repo (no other dependencies needed)
- templating
- hooks / scripts  (chezmoi seems to provide more hooks)
- Bitwarden & other password managers (chezmoi only)
- Encryption (chezmoi only)
